    "# Multinomial Logistic Regression from scratch\n",
    "\n",
    "In statistics, **multinomial logistic regression** is a classification method that generalizes logistic regression to multiclass problems, i.e. with more than two possible discrete outcomes where one sample could belong only to one class.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The whole model, including the activation function can be written as:\n",
    "$$\\hat{y} = softmax(xW+b)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This model is sometimes called multiclass logistic regression. Other common names for it include _softmax regression_ and _multinomial regression_.\n",
    "\n",
    "__What does the model actually do?__\n",
    "\n",
    "* **First:** it transforms the input vector $x$ of size `input_features_number` to the new vector $z$ of size `number_of_classes`.\n",
    "* **Second:** it applies softmax over the output vector $z$ to make its components look like probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, given an **input vector x**, model computes new vector $z = Wx+b$. Then softmax does two things. First, it exponentiates (elementwise) $e^z$, forcing all values to be strictly positive. Then it normalizes so that all values sum to 1. The softmax operation computes the following:\n",
    "$$softmax(z) = \\frac{e^{z}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{k} e^{z_i}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, we get the vector $\\hat{y}$ of the same dimension as the vector **z** (and equal to the number of classes) but its components look like probability distribution over the classes we want to assign to objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we have **k** classes, we’ll need weights connecting each of our inputs $x_i$ to each of our outputs $z_j$. Graphically, the network looks something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/zackchase/mxnet-the-straight-dope/blob/master/img/simple-softmax-net.png?raw=true\">\n",
    "\n",
    "----- \n",
    "** Optional part**\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also interesting to see what happens if we have only two classes and perform softmax (the bias vector $b$ isn't shown here explicitly, but it is an additional component of $w$ and $x$).\n",
    "\n",
    "* $$P(y=1|x) = \\frac{e^{xw_1}}{e^{xw_0+xw_1-xw_1} + e^{xw_1}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* $$P(y=1|x) = \\frac{e^{xw_1}}{e^{xw_0-xw_1}e^{xw_1} + e^{xw_1}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* $$P(y=1|x) = \\frac{e^{xw_1}}{e^{xw_1}(e^{xw_0-xw_1} + 1)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* $$P(y=1|x) = \\frac{1}{e^{xw_0-xw_1} + 1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* $$P(y=1|x) = \\frac{1}{e^{x\\tilde{w}} + 1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And we actually get sigmoid(logistic) function used in logistic regression.\n",
